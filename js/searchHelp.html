<span class="hd">Hanyu Pinyin</span><br>
<p>Use tone numbers, 1 to 4, to indicate tone accents (声调); eg xin4 is
equivalent to <span class="p">xìn</span>. Use tone number 5 for the relaxed tone (轻声);
eg (哥哥) ge1ge5. Searching without any tone number will return all tone variations.</p>

<p>Use v for <span span class="p">ü</span>. For example, to search for <span class="p">nü</span>(女), type nv in the search bar. note that v is a widely-used convenient keyboard alternative for <span class="p">ü</span>.</p>

<span class="hd">Chinese/pinyin words and phrases</span><br>
<p>How <i>Pinyin Cidian</i> searches chinese/pinyin words is dependent on how each search string is constructed and the selected <i>search logic</i>. For example,</p>
<ul>
<li>xin jia po (will search for dictionary entries with all the 3 terms "xin" "jia" and "po" in the default "search all" logic. However, the hit terms may not be in sequence and can appear in different data fields)</li>
<li>xin1 jia1 po1  (is similar to the above but more specific and this is the same as searching <span class="p">xīn jīa pō</span>)</li>
<li>xinjiapo (without space seperators, will be treated as a phrase; hits will be registered only if the pinyin terms are found in sequence)</li>
<li>xin1jia1po1 (as a phrase with tone numbers and is equivalent to <span class="p">xīnjīapō</span>)</li>
</ul>
<p>Similarly, searching "回转" without any spacing will only result in hits with 回转 (rotation) occuring in sequence.
"回 转" with a seperating space will be treated as two search terms and will also return 转回 (to turn back).
</p>

<p>
Enclosing terms in double quotes will produce a search phrase; for example "as soon as". Also note that "beijing daxue" (with the double quotes) is the same as searching beijingdaxue.
</p>

<span class="hd">Strokes-Bushou (笔画部手)</span><br>
<p>To search for a chinese character that you don't know its pinyin
or what it means in english, you can use the
Strokes-Bushou (笔画部手) method. First count the total number
of strokes in the chinese character. Counting the strokes
reinforces your recognition of the character. Lets suppose we
are searching for 捏. It has 10 strokes. Type in 10 into the
search bar and click search. Select "部手 view" and you will be presented
with a panel of bushou. The number in each bushou indicates the corresponding
number of hits that can be found.
Click on the bushou of 捏 which in this case is 扌and locate 捏.</p>
<p>
To help you locate your bushou, you can do one of the following,
<li>simplify the bushou panel by selecting <img src="img/bsstrokesButton.png" style="vertical-align:middle;">
which is the number of strokes for 扌. This will present
only 3 strokes bushou.</li>
<li>If you know the pinyin of your bushou, then enter 10.shou in
the search bar</li>
<li>make use of <img src="img/bsNxPrButtons.png" style="vertical-align:middle;">to change
the number of strokes just in case you have counted your
strokes wrongly.</li>
</p>

<span class="hd">Bushou-Pinyin (部手拼音)</span><br>
<p>Bushou-Pinyin is a refinement suffix that can be attached
to any pinyin and strokes. For example, 
<a href='#qry[src]=ci4.dao&qry[srt]=scoreHits&qry[psz]=20&qry[sfx]=exact&qry[fil]=0'>
ci4.dao
</a>
 is a search
on pinyin ci4 with bushou-pinyin dao. eg 刺 with bushou刂
</p>

<span class="hd">Advanced Search Logic</span><br>
<p>
For the more technically savy, the <i>boolean</i> logical operators (and, or not) can be
used in constructing more specific search queries, the following are examples,
</p>


<p> Search for either nanjing university or beijing university
<a href='#qry[src]="nanjing university" or "beijing university"&qry[srt]=scoreHits&qry[psz]=20&qry[sfx]=exact&qry[fil]=0'>
"nanjing university" or "beijing university"
</a>
</p>

<p> Search for characters with pinyin yi1 but not the english word "one"
<a href='#qry[src]=yi1 not one&qry[srt]=scoreHits&qry[psz]=20&qry[sfx]=exact&qry[fil]=0'>
yi1 not one
</a>
</p>

<p> Search for sun in the english field only
<a href='#qry[src]=field:en sun&qry[srt]=scoreHits&qry[psz]=20&qry[sfx]=exact&qry[fil]=0'>
field:en sun
</a>. Note that only the first field command is used. If there are more than one field command
given, the rest are ignored. Contrast this with 
<a href='#qry[src]=sun&qry[srt]=scoreHits&qry[psz]=20&qry[sfx]=exact&qry[fil]=0'>
sun
</a> and you will see the difference. See also the difference between 
<a href='#qry[src]=field:en run&qry[srt]=scoreHits&qry[psz]=20&qry[sfx]=exact&qry[fil]=0'>
field:en run
</a> and 
<a href='#qry[src]=run&qry[srt]=scoreHits&qry[psz]=20&qry[sfx]=exact&qry[fil]=0'>
run
</a>
